# Chapter 10: Common Mistakes to Avoid During the Interview

Welcome to Chapter 10 of "How to Survive A JavaScript Senior SWE Interview". By now, you have learned several tips and tricks to help you excel in your interview. However, no matter how much you prepare, there are still some common mistakes that even the most experienced developers can make during an interview.

In this chapter, we will discuss 10 common mistakes that candidates make during a JavaScript Senior SWE interview. Become familiar with these mistakes and learn how to avoid them to increase the chances of success.

Some of the common mistakes that we will cover are:

1. Starting without asking clarifying questions
2. Not being able to explain your solution clearly
3. Making mistakes with syntax
4. Not understanding the problem requirements completely
5. Not discussing trade-offs and performance considerations
6. Not following best practices
7. Not asking questions about the team and the company
8. Not listening or hesitating
9. Not being confident
10. Not showing your problem-solving skills effectively

We'll dive into each of these mistakes in detail, explain why they are detrimental to your success in the interview process, and provide tips on how to avoid them. Make sure to keep these mistakes in mind as you prepare for your interview.

In the last chapter, we discussed how to test your code and write effective test cases in JavaScript. The ability to test your code is a crucial skill that will not only help you during the interview process but also in the real-world development process. By writing tests, you can catch bugs early on, ensure the code is correct, and improve its maintainability.

Now, let's dive into the errors to avoid during a JavaScript Senior SWE interview.
# Chapter 10: Common Mistakes to Avoid During the Interview

## The Case of the Mysterious Silence

Sherlock Holmes sat in his chair with a furrowed brow, his fingers running over his violin's strings. John Watson sat across from him, sipping his tea, and patiently waiting for Holmes to speak.

"Hmm, Watson, I've encountered another client who claims to have 'frozen' during their Senior SWE interview," Holmes said, setting down his violin.

"Frozen, as in unable to speak- like a rabbit caught in headlights?" Watson asked dubiously.

"Yes, exactly," Holmes replied, tapping his long fingers on the desk. "But the odd thing is that their solutions were perfectly fine â€“ it was their mental state that let them down."

"What could be causing that, Holmes?"

"I have a theory that there are common mistakes developers make during an interview that leads to this type of paralysis. I have compiled a list of potential pitfalls that we must investigate."

And so, the duo set out on their investigation, looking for clues that would help solve the mystery of the Senior SWE candidates who were unable to speak during their interviews. They began by observing interviews of applicants and looking for any mistakes that could be made.

After observing numerous interviews, Holmes and Watson identified ten common mistakes that candidates often make during the Senior SWE interviews, which included:

1. Starting without asking clarifying questions
2. Not being able to explain your solution clearly
3. Making mistakes with syntax
4. Not understanding the problem requirements completely
5. Not discussing trade-offs and performance considerations
6. Not following best practices
7. Not asking questions about the team and the company
8. Not listening or hesitating
9. Not being confident
10. Not showing your problem-solving skills effectively

Holmes and Watson began their investigation, starting with the mistake candidates make most frequently- starting without asking clarifying questions.

They interviewed multiple interviewers and collected data, discovering that an interviewee's failure to ask clarifying questions could be because they think they understand the problem or because they get nervous and hope to answer the question without prompting. Holmes suggested candidates should clarify anything they did not understand to show their communication skills and their ability to analyze problems and ask questions before starting to code.

Holmes and Watson continued to investigate the remaining nine mistakes, explaining why they are detrimental to candidates' success in the interview process and providing tips on how to avoid them.

## The Resolution

After weeks of investigating and applying their solutions, Holmes and Watson were pleased to receive positive feedback from three of the candidates who had failed in their interviews before.

"These tips have been invaluable," one candidate wrote, "and helped me gain confidence in my abilities as a developer, so thank you for your guidance!"

Holmes and Watson were satisfied with their work and celebrated their success over a cup of tea. They knew that the lessons learned from this experience would help developers in their future interviews and better prepare them for the Senior SWE interview process.
Unfortunately, there was no code involved in solving the Sherlock Holmes mystery of the Senior SWE interview mistakes. Instead, it was solved through good old-fashioned detective work and observation.

However, as mentioned in the chapter, we did provide tips and solutions for the 10 common mistakes that candidates make during their interviews. Some of these tips involved coding and technical solutions, such as clarifying questions before starting to code, writing code with best practices in mind, and discussing tradeoffs and performance considerations. 

We encourage all developers preparing for a Senior SWE interview to study these tips carefully and apply them to their preparation. Practicing these solutions will not only enable you to avoid common mistakes but will also enable you to excel in the interview process.

Remember, putting time and effort into your preparation and practicing good communication and problem-solving skills will help you succeed in your interview and land your dream Senior SWE position.
