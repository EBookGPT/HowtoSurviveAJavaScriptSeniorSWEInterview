# How to Survive A JavaScript Senior SWE Interview - Code Explanation

In the story of Robin Hood and her successful JavaScript Senior SWE interview, she demonstrated her technical proficiency and problem-solving skills through her coding abilities. In order to succeed in a JavaScript Senior SWE interview, it's important to have a thorough understanding of key concepts and be able to apply them to real-world problems.

One possible example of code that Robin might have used to impress her interviewers is a function that checks whether a given JavaScript object is empty or not. This is a commonly asked question in interviews for software engineering roles.

Here is an example function in JavaScript:

```javascript
function isEmpty(obj) {
    for(var key in obj) {
        if(obj.hasOwnProperty(key))
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

This function iterates over each key in the given object and checks if it exists within the object. If it does, the function returns false, indicating that the object is not empty. If not, the function returns true, indicating that the object is indeed empty.

Here's an example of how this function can be used:

```javascript
const myObject = {};
console.log(isEmpty(myObject)); // Output: true
myObject.myProperty = 'something';
console.log(isEmpty(myObject)); // Output: false
```

In the story, Robin demonstrated her proficiency in JavaScript by explaining how such a function works and how it can be applied to real-world problems. By showing her coding skills and ability to problem-solve, she was able to impress the interviewers and land her dream Senior SWE position.

In conclusion, understanding key concepts and being able to apply them to real-world problems is essential to succeeding in a JavaScript Senior SWE interview. By practicing and demonstrating your coding abilities, you can be prepared to impress interviewers and land your dream job, just like Robin did.
