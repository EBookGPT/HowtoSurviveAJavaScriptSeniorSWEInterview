# Chapter 5: Debugging and Troubleshooting Techniques

Welcome to the final chapter of our book, "How to Survive A JavaScript Senior SWE Interview". In the previous chapter, we covered data structures and algorithms, which are essential topics to ace your interview. 

Now, we move on to the final chapter where we will talk about debugging and troubleshooting techniques. Debugging is an essential skill that every developer should possess. Being able to troubleshoot and fix bugs efficiently is what separates a novice developer from a senior one.

In this chapter, we will cover various techniques that can help you debug code effectively. We will also provide some common debugging scenarios and the solutions to those problems.

# Dracula's Dilemma

Dracula, a senior developer, was tasked to fix a bug that was causing trouble for the entire team. He was given a piece of code that was not behaving as expected, and the team was depending on him to find the problem and fix it.

Dracula opened the code and tried to understand the problem. He went through the code line by line, but he couldn't find the root cause of the issue. After a few hours of debugging, he realized that he needed a smarter approach to solve this problem.

## Breakpoints

Dracula decided to use breakpoints to stop execution at specific points in the code so he can examine the state. By doing so, he could step through the code and see which line of code was causing the issue. 

``` javascript
for(let i =0; i<=10; i++){
  console.log(i);
}
```

Using breakpoints, Dracula found out that the loop was not terminating at 10, but it was looping infinitely. He then realized that he had made a small mistake in his loop comparison operator. He changed `i<=10` to `i<10`, and the loop terminated correctly.

This simple example highlights the importance of using breakpoints. It can save a lot of time and effort in finding and fixing bugs.

## Logging

Another technique that Dracula used was logging. Logging is a way to print useful information to the console that can help identify the problem.

``` javascript
function calculate(num1, num2){
  console.log(`Calculating ${num1} + ${num2}`);
  return num1 + num2;
}

console.log(calculate(5,4));
```

Using logging, Dracula found the problem with his function. The function was returning the wrong value. By adding logging statements, he was able to identify the problem, fix it, and ensure that the function was behaving as expected.

## Debugging tools

Lastly, Dracula utilized various debugging tools provided by the browser to help him find and fix bugs. These tools include the console, debugger statement, and the Elements tab.

Using the Elements tab, Dracula was able to inspect the DOM elements and modify them on the fly, which helped him see how the page was rendering. By using the console and the debugger statement, he was able to step through the code and find the root cause of the problem.

# Conclusion

In this chapter, we covered various debugging and troubleshooting techniques that can help you solve problems effectively. These techniques include breakpoints, logging, and debugging tools. Remember to use these techniques to your advantage, and it will make you a more efficient and productive developer.

As you go through your next senior SWE interview, remember to practice these techniques and show the interviewer how you can effectively troubleshoot and debug code.
## Explanation of code

In this chapter, we introduced Dracula, a senior developer who had to debug and fix a piece of code that his team was struggling with. Dracula utilized various debugging and troubleshooting techniques to identify the problem and fix it.

### Breakpoints

The first debugging technique that Dracula used was breakpoints. Breakpoints can be used to stop execution at a specific line of code to see the variable values at that point in the program's execution. 

``` javascript
for(let i =0; i<=10; i++){
  console.log(i);
}
```

In the code snippet above, Dracula struggled to identify why the loop was not terminating. By adding a breakpoint to the conditional statement, he could see the state of the `i` variable and determine why the loop wasn't ending as expected. 

### Logging

The second debugging technique that Dracula used was logging. Logging is a way to print useful information to the console that can help identify and fix the problem.

``` javascript
function calculate(num1, num2){
  console.log(`Calculating ${num1} + ${num2}`);
  return num1 + num2;
}

console.log(calculate(5,4));
```

In the code snippet above, Dracula added logging statements to understand why the function was returning the wrong value. By examining the logged output, he could identify and fix the problem with the function. 

### Debugging tools

Lastly, Dracula utilized various debugging tools provided by the browser, such as the console, debugger statement, and Elements tab. 

Using the Elements tab, Dracula could inspect the DOM elements and modify them on the fly, which helped him see how the page was rendering. By using the console and the debugger statement, he could step through the code and find the root cause of the problem.

By using breakpoints, logging, and debugging tools, Dracula was able to identify and fix the problems in the code. These are just a few examples of how to approach debugging and troubleshooting, and there are many more techniques that you can use to solve problems effectively.
